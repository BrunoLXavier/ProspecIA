# Style and Conventions
- Language and naming: Code identifiers in English (EN-US). UI text must come from i18n keys (next-i18next; use `t()`/`useI18n()`); avoid hardcoded strings. Keep ACL- and status-driven flows explicit before actions.
- Architecture: Apply SOLID and Clean Architecture. Keep domain/use_cases free of framework concerns; adapters/infrastructure handle IO (DB, Kafka, MinIO, Keycloak). Prefer dependency inversion via interfaces. CRUDs are status-based; avoid deletions except admin-only; auditability and versioning are required.
- Backend formatting/linting: Black + isort (black profile), line length 100. Flake8 ignore E203/E266/W503; per-file ignore __init__.py:F401. Type hints and docstrings expected; mypy configured (ignore_missing_imports=true). Structured logging (structlog) and explicit error handling/backoff in adapters.
- Backend testing: Pytest with coverage (`tests` folder, test_* naming). Keep fixtures deterministic; favor unit over integration when possible. Maintain observability (metrics/logs) for new endpoints.
- Frontend lint/format: ESLint (next/core-web-vitals) with hook rules enforced; warn on console except warn/error. Prettier (+ tailwind plugin) for formatting. TypeScript-first with strict typings; prefer Zod schemas where applicable.
- Frontend patterns: Use React Query for data fetching/caching; React Hook Form for forms; Tailwind with consistent utility ordering (prettier-plugin-tailwindcss). Gate UI with `useACL()`; ensure accessibility (aria, lang, focus). Keep layouts and components localization-ready (labels via translations, date/number formatting by locale).
